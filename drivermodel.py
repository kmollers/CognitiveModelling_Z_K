### Car / driving related parameters

steeringUpdateTime = 250    #in ms ## How long does one steering update take? (250 ms consistent with Salvucci 2005 Cognitive Science)
timeStepPerDriftUpdate = 50 ### msec: what is the time interval between two updates of lateral position?
startingPositionInLane = 0.27 			#assume that car starts already slightly away from lane centre (in meters) (cf. Janssen & Brumby, 2010)


#parameters for deviations in car drift due the simulator environment: See Janssen & Brumby (2010) page 1555
gaussDeviateMean = 0
gaussDeviateSD = 0.13 ##in meter/sec


#When the car is actively controlled, calculate a value using equation (1) in Janssen & Brumby (2010). However, some noise is added on top of this equation to account for variation in human behavior. See Janssen & Brumby (2010) page 1555. Also see function "updateSteering" on how this function is used
gaussDriveNoiseMean = 0
gaussDriveNoiseSD = 0.1	#in meter/sec


### The car is controlled using a steering wheel that has a maximum angle. Therefore, there is also a maximum to the lateral velocity coming from a steering update
maxLateralVelocity = 1.7	# in m/s: maximum lateral velocity: what is the maximum that you can steer?
minLateralVelocity = -1* maxLateralVelocity

startvelocity = 0 	#a global parameter used to store the lateral velocity of the car


###
### Switch related parameters
###
retrievalTimeWord = 200   #ms. ## How long does it take to think of the next word when interleaving after a word (time not spent driving, but drifting)
retrievalTimeSentence = 300 #ms. ## how long does it take to retrieve a sentence from memory (time not spent driving, but drifting)



###
### parameters for typing task
###
timePerWord = 0  ### ms ## How much time does one word take
wordsPerMinuteMean = 39.33   # parameters that control typing speed: when typing two fingers, on average you type this many words per minute. From Jiang et al. (2020; CHI)
wordsPerMinuteSD = 10.3 ## this si standard deviation (Jiang et al, 2020)


## Function to reset all parameters. Call this function at the start of each simulated trial. Make sure to reset GLOBAL parameters.

## Function to determine lateral velocity (controlled with steering wheel) based on where car is currently positioned. See Janssen & Brumby (2010) for more detailed explanation. Lateral velocity update depends on current position in lane. Intuition behind function: the further away you are, the stronger the correction will be that a human makes
def vehicleUpdateActiveSteering(LD):

	latVel = 0.2617 * LD*LD + 0.0233 * LD - 0.022
	returnValue = velocityCheckForVectors(latVel)
	return returnValue
	



### function to update steering angle in cases where the driver is NOT steering actively (when they are distracted by typing for example)
def vehicleUpdateNotSteering():
    
    global gaussDeviateMean
    global gaussDeviateSD 

    

    vals = numpy.random.normal(loc=gaussDeviateMean, scale=gaussDeviateSD,size=1)[0]
    returnValue = velocityCheckForVectors(vals)
    return returnValue





### Function to run a trial. Needs to be defined by students (section 2 and 3 of assignment)

                firstWord=0

        if(trialTime % 50 == 0)  ### check the drift
	
	




### function to run multiple simulations. Needs to be defined by students (section 3 of assignment)
def runSimulations(nrSims = 100):
